## Welcome! 👋
This is a solution to the FAQ accordion card challenge on Frontend Mentor. 

## The challenge
Your challenge is to build out this FAQ accordion card and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
